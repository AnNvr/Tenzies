 practice on props, state and effect

1. SET UP LAYOUT: first of all, drafting the layout with some basic CSS to render the idea and working over it afterward;

2. DIE COMPONENTS: Since I don't have an array of objects with an id yet, I start with defining a Die component to pass props for rendering the props.value in a text element. The value given to the props will be initially hard code, just for initial rendering.

3. BREAKDOWN - GENERATE ARRAY: Now I can create an array of 10 random numbers to iterate over and render it to screen. I define a function allNewDice() that returns the array of 10 random numbers between 1-6 inclusive. I have different ways to create an array to iterate over it: I can use an array constructor, or I can define an empty array, iterate with for...loop 10 times, and push a random number in it. I decided to use an array constructor to test a method I never used before, and reduce the lines of code.

4. BREAKDWON - MAP OVER THE ARRAY: I create a new state to hold the value of the array returned in the function allNewDice(). Since the function holds the array, I assign the function to the original state. I map over state array, and return the Die component assigning key and value. The props value is equal to the random number generated in the body function of the array constructor.

5. BUTTON - I need a button to fire up the game and call the function allNewDice(). I create an handleClick() function and I fire up the setter function passing allNewDice as an argument.

6. HOLD DICE IN PLACE: I need to hold dice in place while the button rolls the other dice. I opted to refactor the code to make it looks more comprehensible for learning purposes and swap the Array constructor with a for...loop to iterate over an empty array to populate with the values generated by Math.random().
But to in order to add more information about a die whether is held or not, I need to turn the array of numbers in an array of Objects with properties, including a prop I call isHeld = boolean. By default I set this property to false.

The logic where I generate random numbers to push into the array is here:
diceArray.push(Math.ceil(Math.random() * 6))
Instead of pushing numbers, I will push objects and assign the random numbers to the value prop.
